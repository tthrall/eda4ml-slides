term	dscr
acyclic	a graph is acyclic if it has no cycles
adjacency	binary indicator: given vertices are / are not endpoints of a common edge
connected component	a maximal connected subgraph
connected graph	a graph is connected if each pair of vertices is connected
connected vertices	a pair of vertices that co-occur in some path
cycle	a finite path whose first and last vertex are the same
degree	number of incident edges of a vertex
directed edge	an ordered pair of vertices (called endpoints of the edge)
edge	a specified pair of vertices (in a hypergraph, more than two vertices)
edge weight	a numerical value assigned to an edge
graph	a system of vertices (nodes) and edges
incidence	if a vertex is an endpoint of an edge, the (vertex, edge) pair is said to be incident
neighborhood, 1-hop	the subgraph of vertices adjacent to a referenced vertex
neighborhood, 1.5-hop	the subgraph induced by a vertex, its adjacent vertices, and their adjacent vertices
neighborhood, 2-hop	the subgraph of vertices of distance 2 from a referenced vertex
path	a sequence of adjacent vertices
simple path	a path in which no vertex is repeated
subgraph	a subset of edges along with their endpoints and possibly additional vertices
subgraph, induced	a subset of vertices along with the edges having both endpoints in the subset
tree, directed	a directed graph having a distinguished root vertex R such that there is exactly one path from R to any other vertex V
tree, undirected	a connected, acyclic graph
