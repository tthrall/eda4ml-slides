  abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {Abstract Statistical concepts and techniques are basic to scientific investigation. One concept that enjoys both a theoretical and a physical existence is the spectrum. A spectrum may be described as a display of the intensity or variability of a phenomenon versus period or frequency. Spectra are particularly useful in the study of systems subject to resonance, but have many other uses. This paper begins with some of the historical development of the field, describing a sequence of contributions by Michelson, Schuster, Einstein, Fisher, Bartlett, Tukey, and Whittle. The paper next presents collaborative applications to the study of the free oscillations of the earth, to the dispersion of seismic surface waves and to nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. Finally, there is mention of open problems and opinions on future directions.},

abstract = {The growing use of computers for mechanized inventory control and production planning has brought with it the need for explicit forecasts of sales and usage for individual products and materials. These forecasts must be made on a routine basis for thousands of products, so that they must be made quickly, and, both in terms of computing time and information storage, cheaply; they should be responsive to changing conditions. The paper presents a method of forecasting sales which has these desirable characteristics, and which in terms of ability to forecast compares favorably with other, more traditional methods. Several models of the exponential forecasting system are presented, along with several examples of application.},
